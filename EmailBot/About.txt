# Email-BOT
Main project using pyyhon -Email Bot
•It is a little bit big project using python.
•In this the user can send email to the reciver without writing a single word .
•Instead of writing the user can speak to the python bot and it will send the mail to the corresponding person.
•Here the imported modules are
    > Smtblib:
         •This is a library for sending mail.SMTP-Simple Mail Transfer Protocols.
         •First i am creating a server by using server of smtp.Server is for a connectivity between two persons.
         •This module will provide the email format in that format we have to send emails.
         •To allow this BOT to send message we have to give permission to access unknown sources.

    > Speech_recognition:
         •This is to make our python listening to what we are speaking.In this we have microphone method for storing the speech from us and recignize_google method for converting our speech into text that will print in the console.
         •This will listens and stores our speeches.
   
    > PyAudio:
         •To use above module we must include pyaudio in our pyyhon text editor.
    
    > Pyttsx3:
         •This library is for converting the text we entered in to speech.
         • we have to initialize it and use it.
         •Now what are the text you typed that will be spoke by our python bot.
         •We can also change the voice to male or female in the property setting.
 
Now here i assigned two email ids with another simple readable word as key-value pairs.
Now the user can say simply 'one' to select a reciever or 'two' to select another reciever.
We can say our subject and messages that will store in smtp mail format.
